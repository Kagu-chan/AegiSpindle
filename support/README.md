AegiSpindle Support
===================

AegiSpindle allow direct support for projects using this library. This means advertising of this projects and code support if required.

A list of supported projects you can view [here](LIST.md).

How does it works?
------------------
It is the main goal to make creating karaoke effects and typesets easier and consistent. This means code, library usage and results. Not everyone have to code the same functions and not everyone does have time or ability to understand how lua works exactly.

If you want to use this library, this would make me happy, and so I decided to support it additionally here with some help. To get your project supported, just follow the rules:

* Your project must be written in LUA and compatible to luajit
* Your project must be hosted and up to date on github
* Your project must extend AegiSpindle
* Your project must keep dependencies as less as possible
* Your project must not change any main functionality of AegiSpindle
* You have to use clean code
* If your project not ready to use and is in development, this is not a problem. But if I see project inactive for long time (before finish) I will stop support.

If this applies, I will provide my help:

* Listing (and advertising) your project
* Keep the main functionality updated
* If I change something of the API, I'll try to inform you to change your code OR change your code by myself and send a pull request
* Try to help finding bugs or weird code and help to fix them

If you want this help, 

* Host your project
* Create an issue ticket and provide following information:
* Description
* One lined description for list page
* Github-Link
