AegiSpindle
===========

Definition
----------
**AegiSpindle**Â is an extended library to use for karaoke templating or typesetting and create ASS (Advanced Substation Alpha) files. 

It can be used as standalone library or as AegiSub plugin. 

It is developet as a compilation and rewrite of FXSpindle (a NyuFX rewrite) and Yutils (a typeset library).

Environment
-----------
It supports scripting in Lua, includes the NyuFX functionality, the Yutils functionality and its own library for creating karaoke effects. 

The Lua environment extended by many functions and variables to make AegiSpindle easier to use and more powerful than simple text manipulation. Pre-calculated values and graphic+media functions allow advanced effects without much effort.

It's recommend to learn ASS as well as Lua before usage, but even without that it's possible to use it since the scripting languages and ASS are really easy to understand and learn.
